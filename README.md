# Mailbox.

A user profile in an Exchange mailbox is a collection of settings and information that pertain to an individual user's mailbox. This includes things like the user's name, email address, and contact information, as well as settings for things like their mailbox size, language preference, and other customization options.

Here are some of the specific settings that may be included in a user's mailbox profile:

- Display name: This is the name that is displayed to other users when they receive an email from the user. It can be different from the user's actual name and can be changed by the user or an administrator.
- Email address: This is the primary email address that is associated with the user's mailbox. It is used to send and receive emails and can be changed by the user or an administrator.
- Contact information: This includes the user's physical address, phone number, and other contact details that may be shared with other users.
- Language preference: This setting allows the user to specify the language that they prefer to use in their mailbox. This can affect the language of the user interface, as well as the language of any emails that the user sends or receives.
- Mailbox size: This setting specifies the maximum size of the user's mailbox, in terms of the number of emails and attachments it can hold. If the mailbox reaches its maximum size, the user may be unable to receive new emails until they delete some of the existing ones to free up space.
- Out-of-office settings: This allows the user to specify an out-of-office message that will be automatically sent to anyone who emails them while they are away. The user can select the start and end dates for the out-of-office period, as well as the message that will be sent.
- Signature: This is a block of text that is automatically added to the bottom of every email that the user sends. It can include things like the user's name, title, and contact information.
- Theme: This setting allows the user to customize the appearance of their mailbox, including the background color and wallpaper.

These are just a few examples of the types of settings that may be included in a user's mailbox profile. The specific settings available will depend on the version of Exchange being used and the permissions granted to the user.

**A mail tip** is a notification or warning that is displayed to a user when they are composing an email message in Microsoft Outlook. Mail tips are designed to help users avoid common mistakes or pitfalls when sending emails, such as sending a message to a large distribution list or forgetting to attach a file.

There are several types of mail tips that can be configured in Outlook, including:

- Recipient limit: This mail tip displays a warning if the user is attempting to send an email to a large number of recipients. This can help prevent the user from accidentally spamming a large group of people.
- External recipient: This mail tip displays a warning if the user is attempting to send an email to an external recipient (someone outside of the user's organization). This can help the user ensure that they have the necessary permissions to send emails to external recipients.
- Attachment reminder: This mail tip displays a warning if the user has included the word "attachment" in the body of their email, but has not actually attached a file to the message.
- Automatic reply: This mail tip displays a warning if the user has an automatic reply set up (such as an out-of-office message), and is attempting to send an email to someone who is also set up to send automatic replies.

Mail tips can be customized by the administrator of an Exchange server, and can be turned on or off for individual users as needed. They are designed to help users send more effective and professional emails and can be a valuable tool for improving communication in an organization.
